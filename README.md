Gems (*) and stones (o) appear randomly and fall from the top of the screen. The player (#) can move left or right along the bottom of the screen. If the player touches a gem, he earns a point. If the player touches a stone, he loses one point. Gems and stones are removed when the player touches them. The game continues until the player closes the window.

Improved gems and rocks (various types, different points). Improved player movement (up and down within a limited range) Improved game play and endgame messages. Improved representation of gems, stones and players (better colors or symbols)
